				Welcome to the <b> Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp.</b> With over 23,000 ratings and a 4.8 average my iOS course is the HIGHEST RATED iOS Course in the history of Drosak! 
				<br><br>
				At 50+ hours, this iOS 12 course is the <b>most comprehensive </b> iOS development course online!
				<br><br>
				This Swift 5 course is based on our in-person app development bootcamp in London, where we've perfected the curriculum over 3 years of in-person teaching. 
				<br><br>
				Our complete app development bootcamp teaches you how to code using Swift 5 and build beautiful iOS 12 apps for iPhone and iPad. Even if you have <b>ZERO</b> programming experience.<span id="dots"><br>...</span><span id="more" style="display: none;"> <br><br>I'll take you step-by-step through engaging and fun video tutorials and teach you everything you need to know to succeed as an iOS app developer.
					<br><br>
					The course includes 50+ <b>hours</b> of HD video tutorials and builds your programming knowledge while making real world apps. e.g. Pokemon Go, Whatsapp, QuizUp and Yahoo Weather.
					<br><br>
					It's updated to include over 7 hours of content on Apple's brand new <b>ARKit 2</b> for making <b>Augmented Reality</b> apps as well as <b>CoreML2 & CreateML</b> for making intelligent apps with <b>Machine Learning</b>. You'll be building your own machine learning models that use Artificial Intelligence to recognise images and emotions in tweets. You'll also be building 3D augmented reality apps that look like Pokemon Go and Harry Potter's magical newspapers!
					<br><br>
					By the end of this course, you will be fluently programming in <b>Swift 5</b> and be ready to make your own apps or start a freelancing job as an iOS 12 developer.
					<br><br>
					You'll also have a portfolio of over 25 apps that you can show off to any potential employer.

					<p>
						I'm Angela, I'm a developer with a passion for teaching. I'm the lead instructor at the London App Brewery, London's leading Programming Bootcamp. I've helped hundreds of thousands of students learn to code and change their lives by becoming a developer. I've been invited by companies such as Twitter, Facebook and Google to teach their employees.
						<br><br>
						My first foray into programming was when I was just 12 years old, wanting to build my own Space Invader game. Since then, I've made hundred of websites, apps and games. But most importantly, I realised that my greatest passion is teaching.
						<br><br>
						I spend most of my time researching how to make learning to code fun and make hard concepts easy to understand. I apply everything I discover into my bootcamp courses. In my courses, you'll find lots of geeky humour but also lots of explanations and animations to make sure everything is easy to understand.
						<br><br>
						I'll be there for you every step of the way.
