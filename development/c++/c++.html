				Which programming language is often seen as a badge of honor among software developers? <b> C++</b>
				<br><br>
				Which programming language can you learn that when added to your resume, will often get you a job
				interview?<b> C++ </b>
				<br><br>
				Which programming language is routinely ranked in the top 5 programming languages by popularity, and
				been consistently in the top 10 for close to 20 years? C++
				<br><br>
				<b> Why you should learn C++</b> <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more" style="display: none;">Much,
					if not most of software written today is still written in C++ and this has been the case for many,
					many years.
					<br><br>
					Not only is C++ popular, it is also a very relevant language. If you go to GitHub you will see that
					there are a huge number of active C++ repositories and C++ is also extremely active on stack
					overflow.
					<br><br>
					There are many, many leading software titles written entirely or partly in C++. These include the
					Windows, Linux and Mac OSX operating systems!
					<br><br>
					Many of the Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator, the mySQL and MongoDB database
					engines, and many many more are written in C++.
					<br><br>
					Leading tech companies use C++ for many of their products and internal research and development.
					These include Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, Google, Facebook, Oracle and many more.
					<br><br>
					<b> Can you see how learning C++ will open up more career opportunities for you?</b>
					<br><br>
					If more professional companies are using C++, it stands to reason that there is going to be more of
					a demand for C++ programmers.
					<br><br>
					But the main reason programmers should probably learn C++ is because it is so powerful!
